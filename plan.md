Of course. Here is a technical implementation plan geared toward an LLM helping you build out your Rust application.

***

## Phase 1: Core Functionality

### 1. Project Setup and Configuration
- **Goal:** Create a new Rust project and set up the basic structure for configuration.
- **LLM Prompt:** "Create a new binary Rust project named `attic-lite`. Add the necessary dependencies to `Cargo.toml` for command-line argument parsing (`clap`), configuration file management (`serde`, `toml`), and error handling (`anyhow`). Create a `Config` struct in a `config.rs` module that can be deserialized from a TOML file. The configuration should include S3 bucket details (bucket name, region, endpoint, access key, secret key) and the number of upload threads."

### 2. S3 Uploader
- **Goal**: Implement the logic for uploading files to your S3-compatible storage.
- **LLM Prompt:** "In a new `s3_uploader.rs` module, create an `S3Uploader` struct that holds the S3 client and configuration. Implement a `new` function that initializes the S3 client from the configuration. Then, create an `upload_nar` async function that takes a file path and an object key as input, and uploads the file to the configured S3 bucket using the `aws-sdk-s3` crate. This function should be able to handle streaming the file content."

### 3. Nix Store Watcher
- **Goal**: Implement the file system watcher to detect new store paths.
- **LLM Prompt:** "Create a `store_watcher.rs` module. Implement a function `watch_store` that takes a `tokio` channel sender as an argument. This function should use the `notify` crate to watch the `/nix/store` directory recursively. When a `Remove` event is detected for a file with a `.lock` extension, extract the store path and send it through the channel. The function should run in a separate thread."

## Phase 2: Integration and Logic

### 4. Main Application Logic
- **Goal**: Tie the configuration, watcher, and uploader together in the main application loop.
- **LLM Prompt:** "In `main.rs`, initialize the configuration and the `S3Uploader`. Create a `tokio` multi-threaded runtime. Spawn the `watch_store` function in a new task. In the main task, create a loop that receives store paths from the channel. For now, just log the received store paths to the console."

### 5. Closure Calculation and Deduplication
- **Goal**: Before uploading, calculate the closure of a store path and check which paths already exist in the cache.
- **LLM Prompt:** "Create a `nix.rs` module. Implement a function `get_store_path_closure` that takes a store path and returns a `Vec<String>` of all its dependencies by shelling out to `nix-store -qR`. In `s3_uploader.rs`, create a function `check_paths_exist` that takes a list of store paths and returns a new list containing only the paths that do **not** already exist in the S3 bucket. You can check for existence by making a `HeadObject` request for the corresponding `.narinfo` object for each path. In your main loop, when you receive a path, get its closure and filter it using `check_paths_exist`."

### 6. NAR Generation and Upload
- **Goal**: For the missing paths, generate the NAR and upload it.
- **LLM Prompt:** "In `nix.rs`, create a function `create_nar` that takes a store path, shells out to `nix-store --dump`, and returns a stream of the NAR content. In your main loop, for each missing path, spawn a new `tokio` task. Inside the task, call `create_nar` to get the NAR stream and then use `s3_uploader.upload_nar` to upload it. Use a `Semaphore` to limit the number of concurrent uploads based on the `upload_threads` configuration."

## Phase 3: Finalizing Touches

### 7. `.narinfo` Generation
- **Goal**: After a NAR is successfully uploaded, generate and upload the corresponding `.narinfo` file.
- **LLM Prompt:** "In `nix.rs`, create a function `get_nar_info` that takes a store path and shells out to `nix-store --query --get-nar-info`. This will return the necessary information to construct the `.narinfo` file. After a NAR is uploaded successfully, call this function, create the `.narinfo` content, and upload it to S3."

By breaking down the project into these focused tasks, you can effectively use an LLM to generate the boilerplate and core logic for each component, allowing you to focus on the integration and refinement of your application.
